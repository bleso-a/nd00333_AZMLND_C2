# Operationalizing Machine Learning

Microsoft Azure, a cloud based solution, provides a machine learning solution which enables model training, deployment and consumption. The solution is used to work with the [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv) by developing a production ready model, deploy and consume the model. In another stage, a pipeline was created, pulished and consumed. Find below the approach followed to complete the project.

- Step 1 - Authentication
- Step 2 - Auto ML Experiment
- Step 3 - Deploy the best model
- Step 4 - Enable Logging
- Step 5 - Swagger Documentation
- Step 6 - Consume Model Endpoints
- Step 7 - Create and Publish a pipeline
- Step 8 - Documentation

## Architectural Diagram

_TODO_: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step.

## Key Steps

_TODO_: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps.

### Step 1 - Authentication

In this step, following the `Az` command, Azure Machine Learning Extension was installed and enabled in the terminal. Next, the procedure was to create the service principal(SP) account - An identity that helps restrcitions based on roles assignment.
After creating the SP account, access was allowed to my workspace. See image below

## Screen Recording

_TODO_ Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions

_TODO (Optional):_ This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
